                <h4>We are pursuing the redesign of this website for few reasons. We consider that they are important reasons and the rationale behind those is presented below:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will transition the website from XHTML to HTML5 (As of October 28, 2014, the revolutionary HTML5 is the official World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation);</li>
                    <li>For video / audio / images we will use fig and figcaption tags for Search Engine Optimization (SEO);</li>
                    <li>Also, for more Search Engine Optimization we will use JavaScript for website in order to make it more dynamic (like the current date and the current day of the week when the lecture takes place);</li>
                    <li>We will add a 404 Error page that will gracefully cover the situations when the links inside the page don’t work and provides an obvious link for the user to return to the previous page;</li>
                    <li>We will add new features (related to the size of the pages and the loading speed) to increase the ranking for Search Engine Optimization (minified html / css / javascript code, cache control, use GZip compression);</li>
                    <li>We will add more relevant content to each lecture’s page (like assignments that are now posted in D2L);</li>
                    <li>We will redesign the layout of the website so that more current and relevant information is at the top of the page;</li>
                    <li>We will use SASS for better website maintenance and future improvements (variables, mixins, nested rules);</li>
                    <li>We will do performance / loading time comparisons using Pingdom Website Speed Test;</li>
                    <li>We will use responsive layouts for mobile clients;</li>
                    <li>We will use printer friendly styles.</li>
                </ul>
